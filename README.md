## Description

This project is a web application using the `shiny` for converting some production rules into an automaton.
Then, this automaton is graphically represented using the `visual-automata` library.

### Important notes

1. This project does not use the `R` programming language, but the `shiny` library for Python. We checked with the professor and he said it was okay to use it.
2. This project reuses the `automaton.py` and `state.py` from our `Lexical Analyzer` project.
3. The only significant modifications to the `automaton.py` would be the modificaation of the `graph()` method to use the `visual-automata` library.
4. The `app.py` is the entry point for the `shiny` application. It includes the parsing of the production rules and the conversion to an automaton, as well as calling the `graph()` method to display the automaton.
5. The final state `Z` is denoted by a double circle in the automaton, instead of it being colored in red. We checked with the professor and he said it was okay to do it this way.
6. The initial state `S` is denoted by an arrow pointing to it in the automaton. We checked with the professor and he said it was okay to do it this way.

## Steps for running

1. Make sure graphviz is installed and in the PATH. If not, install it using the following command:

- In Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install graphviz
```

- In MacOS:

```bash
brew install graphviz
```

- In Windows:

To be honest, windows is kind of a pain. I recommend using WSL2 with Ubuntu instead, and then following the Ubuntu instructions.

2. Clone the repo, install the dependencies, and run the application:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:adpadillar/automaton-graph-converter.git
cd automaton-graph-converter
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install shiny visual-automata forbiddenfruit frozendict
shiny run app.py
```

2. Open the browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/`
